## Introduction

**Mention** is clean and minimalistic theme with few nice features, **scroll indicator** 
and **reading time**. We got inspired with https://mention.com/blog/ and the guys from Mention give as green light, to go and craft Ghost theme.



### Features
- Scroll indicator
- Reading time
- Fully responsive
- Social link icons in footer
- Social media share buttons (Facebook, Twiter and Google plus)
- [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto) google font
- Custom tagline and CTA button in header


### To do:
- Google analytics
- Disquss comments
- Adding [Swift](swifticons.com) icons
- Animations & Motion Graphics
- Better menu for mobile devices

### Demo

You can change the *tagline* and *button* text/link inside default.hbs file by editing [this code](https://github.com/vanila-io/mention-ghost-theme/blob/master/default.hbs#L72-L75) 

### Footer

Link your social profiles in the icons at the bottom of the blog by editing [this code](https://github.com/vanila-io/mention-ghost-theme/blob/master/default.hbs#L91-L94) 

If you can leave that comment in footer that says it's `crafted by Vanila` (http://vanila.io), it 
would mean a lot, cause it represents our work.

Peace
